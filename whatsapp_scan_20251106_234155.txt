~Arya +1 (647) 331-8805: I know so many of us were taught to be the “good girl.”
To keep it together. Be nice. Don’t rock the boat.
And somewhere along the way, we forgot what it feels like to be us.

That’s why I’m hosting Good Girl Rehab next week — a free 5-day challenge inside my Wild & Embodied community.

It’s a space to start unlearning all the ways we shrink ourselves — and remember what it’s like to move, speak, and live from your real self again.

Both the challenge and the community are completely free.
Just come as you are — you don’t have to have it all figured out.

We start Monday.

Join us and check into rehab 😘👇

Expansive Men Adam Sounds good man. Wasnt trying to rush you, just letting you know. These are obviously important decisions, and needs to be considered properly. 
The only part which I mentioned is your room for the FHSA account which you dont want to lose for this year. Other things even if delayed doesnt make any difference.

CRT Level 2-5 Hub You reacted ❤️ to "I just got news this morning that my Dad has cancer in his lungs, kidneys, liver and colon. It was a total shock. He's in the hospital, and I'm going to NY to visit him in a few days. We haven't received any life expectancy, which is usually just a wild guess anyway. My family has decided not to tell him the prognosis as of yet.
I'm feeling sort of numb. I'm also sitting with whatever emotions I have and accepting them. 
Even though I'm far away in Colombia, I feel really connected to CRT, so I wanted to share here."
